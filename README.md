# Flutter_DeployTrial

The running ui folder shows the UI we build which we were going to do a trial to connect to the firebase

However, the second folder "login" does not run, it gives us this error "PlatformException (PlatformException(channel-error, Unable to establish connection on channel., null, null))"
